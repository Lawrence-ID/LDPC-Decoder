Chisel Project Template
=======================

You've done the [Chisel Bootcamp](https://github.com/freechipsproject/chisel-bootcamp), and now you
are ready to start your own Chisel project.  The following procedure should get you started
with a clean running [Chisel3](https://www.chisel-lang.org/) project.

## Make your own Chisel3 project

### Dependencies

#### JDK 8 or newer

We recommend LTS releases Java 8 and Java 11. You can install the JDK as your operating system recommends, or use the prebuilt binaries from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).

#### SBT or mill

SBT is the most common build tool in the Scala community. You can download it [here](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html).  
mill is another Scala/Java build tool without obscure DSL like SBT. You can download it [here](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/mill/releases)

#### Verilator

The test with `svsim` needs Verilator installed.
See Verilator installation instructions [here](https://verilator.org/guide/latest/install.html).

### How to get started

```sh
git clone git@github.com:Lawrence-ID/LDPC-Decoder.git
cd LDPC-Decoder
git submodule update --init
```
### How to run test

```sh
mill resolve __.test
mill __.test
```
